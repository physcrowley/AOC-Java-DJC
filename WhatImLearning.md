# Lessons learned

## Day 1

It's super important to know how to read files and parse text

## Day 3, 4, 5

Data structures simplify algorithms... it is handy to be familiar with their methods.

## Day 6

A logical error on file input (splitting input into String[] entries by '\n' and defining groups as being followed by a blank line '\n' made it so the last group was never tabulated) cost me a lot of time and head-scratching because the algorithm SHOULD have been working (it was).

This taught me that using a small test input file (the examples in each problem) instead of only iterating over partial input could have helped me see the problem sooner.

## Youtube -> Reducible

Just watched the Dynamic programming episode and it seems to apply directly to Day 7's first problem. Acyclical directed graphs for the relationships between bag colours.
